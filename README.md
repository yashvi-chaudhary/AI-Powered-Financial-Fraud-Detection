# 💳 AI-Powered Financial Fraud Detection System

An end-to-end Machine Learning based application that detects fraudulent financial transactions using multiple classification algorithms and provides real-time predictions through a Flask web application.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Financial fraud detection is a critical challenge in the banking and financial sector. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to classify transactions as:

- ✅ Genuine Transactions
- ⚠️ Fraudulent Transactions

The system analyzes transaction patterns and predicts whether a transaction is suspicious or legitimate.

# ⚙️ Installation & Setup

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/yashvi-chaudhary/AI-Powered-Financial-Fraud-Detection.git
```

## 2. Navigate to project directory

```bash
cd AI-Powered-Financial-Fraud-Detection
```

## 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# ▶️ How to Run the Application

Run Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Enter transaction details and click:

```
Start Prediction
```

The system will classify the transaction as:

```
✅ Legitimate Transaction

or

⚠️ Fraudulent Transaction Detected
```

# 📊 Dataset Information

Dataset used:

Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Dataset contains:

- 284,807 transactions
- 30 input features
- 1 target variable (Class)

Target:

```
0 → Genuine Transaction
1 → Fraudulent Transaction
```

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

## 📥 Dataset

The original dataset (`creditcard.csv`) is not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.

You can download it from the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset and place it inside the `dataset/` folder before running the project.

Expected path:

```text
dataset/
└── creditcard.csv
```
